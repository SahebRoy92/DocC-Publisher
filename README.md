# DocC-Publisher

A repository example on how to use Github actions and Github Pages - 

1. Compile Xcode Project
2. Extract Documentation from `.swift` files itself.
3. Generate `.docc` format documentation
4. Convert them into static `.html`
5. Host them on Github Pages, via Github Actions.
6. The documentation generated will be updated on every push on the branch, so we would get the latest documentation of API and classes always.


Documentation of this project is auto generated and deployed at https://sahebroy92.github.io/DocC-Publisher/
